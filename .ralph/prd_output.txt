I have a few clarifying questions before generating the PRD:

---

**1. Theme Toggle Behavior**
Should users be able to toggle between dark/light themes, or is this a permanent switch to light-only?
- A) **Light-only (permanent)** - Remove dark theme entirely, app is always light
- B) **Toggle (user choice)** - Add a theme switcher so users can choose dark or light  
- C) **System preference** - Follow the user's OS/browser dark mode setting

**2. Color Exceptions**
Are there any components with custom colors that shouldn't change (e.g., brand colors, status indicators, charts)?
- A) No exceptions - convert everything
- B) Keep brand/accent colors the same
- C) Keep status colors (success/error/warning) unchanged
- D) I need to review what should stay fixed

**3. Current Theming Setup**
Does the project use CSS variables for theming, or are colors hardcoded throughout?
- A) CSS variables already exist (using `--var()` syntax)
- B) Mostly hardcoded in Tailwind classes
- C) Not sure - please investigate the codebase

**4. Scope Boundaries**
What's included in "all styles"?
- A) App pages only (dashboard, forms, user screens)
- B) Everything (landing, marketing, all pages)
- C) Specific pages only (you'll specify)

**5. Design Reference**
Do you have a light theme design/mockup, or should I derive the light colors from the existing dark palette?

Please answer these and I'll generate a precise PRD for the theme conversion.
